# nodejs-mc-hello-world

This is my NodeJS Master Class refresher "Hello World" project. I added a small twist in that it responds with "Hello World" and a spurious list of translations of "Hello World". I apologize in advance for any poor translations or missing languages.

I borrowed the code list from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5580876/navigator-language-list-of-all-languages) and filled in the blanks from [StackExchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/146544/hello-world-in-multiple-languages) and Google Translate. I'm hoping maybe the community can help me out with some of the missing codes and translations... Thanks in advance for any helpful pull requests.
